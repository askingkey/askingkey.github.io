            About Me

            👋 Hi! I’m Keyao Zhu (朱珂瑶) — a bioinformatics student who just finished a B.S. at Soochow University (2021–2025) and will start my PhD at Peking University’s Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies (2025– ). I enjoy turning noisy, high‑dimensional biomedical data into clear, testable insights.

            🎓 Education

                PhD (2025– ?) · Peking University, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies

                B.S. (2021–2025) · Soochow University, Bioinformatics (Pasteur Elite Class); Minor in Computer Science

            🧬 I’m broadly interested in spatial single‑cell multi‑omics and trustworthy machine learning for biomedicine—with a focus on interpretability, reproducibility, and clinical translation.

            💻 Toolbox: Python & R, Linux & Git, Seurat/Scanpy, scikit‑learn/PyTorch, plus solid statistical grounding. Clean code, version control, and end‑to‑end reproducibility matter a lot to me.

            ☕ When I’m not debugging, you’ll find me fine‑tuning scientific figures’ typography, learning knowledge, or chasing a better espresso shot.

            📫 Contact: keyzh99@gmail.com — always happy to talk about spatial omics, cfDNA, or trustworthy ML in biology. 🚀
